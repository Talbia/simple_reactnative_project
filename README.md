- Open terminal and type, `expo init myproject`
- choose `blank workflow`
- `cd myproject` to go the project directory
- `code .`
- `npm start`

once you install the `expo` app on your physical device, use the QR code to test the app directly on your device and allow you to open up the app inside expo to preview it. On the other hand, you can also `run on Android device/emulator` on your virtual device with the help of Android studio.
